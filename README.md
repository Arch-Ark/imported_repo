# all-over-again
masters thesis work all over again

funny repo title yeah?..

I just ran of titles, given that i had to redo this again!. -> almost frustrating, but I'll trust the ride.

the idea is to juxtapose three CNN models:
- Single Input Convolutional Neural Network
- Double Input Convolutional Neural Network
- Triple Input Convolutional Neural Network

dataset would be the EMNIST dataset.

input variations would be:
- binarized images
- gradient magnitude images
- gaussina blur image

pre-processing techniques
- thinning
- thresholding for contrast enhancement
- centered images
- padded images
